## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2025 session called AD160 - Get Hands-On with Joule: Boost Your SAP Build Development with AI.  

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to AI Driven development. You will create a new lightweight incident management application on the SAP BTP using SAP Build Code with the new agnetic coding capabilities provided by SAP's MCP servers. The application will be based on the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) in the backend and have an SAP Fiori Elements UI as frontend. The application will also have a connectivity from the SAP BTP to an SAP S/4HANA system.
